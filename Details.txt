The terms used in the project are as follows.

Month-to-Date (MTD)
Month-over-Month (MoM) percentage % (growth or shrinking)

1.	Total Loan Applications: Total number of loan applications received during a specified period.
2.	Total Funded Amount: The total amount of funds disbursed as loans.
3.	Total Amount Received: The total amount received from borrowers.
4.	Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans
5.	Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. It's calculated by dividing monthly debts by gross monthly income.

Good Loan - This category includes loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'
Bad Loan - This category includes loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'
